    <h2>More about Him</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The Professor was the mastermind behind the heist.</li>
        <li>He controlled the entirety of the heist from behind the scenes.</li>
        <li>He is, however, a "prankster" so to speak, 
            embarrassing Inspector Raquel by asking embarrassing questions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>His partners</h2>
    <p>The professor has several partners. I think he trusted Berlin the most.
